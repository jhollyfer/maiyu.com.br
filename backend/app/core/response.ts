 * so use-cases and the exception handler do not repeat the declaration.
 *
 * `Paginated<T>` is what a listing builds with
 * `{ meta: paginator.getMeta(), data: paginator.all() }`: `all()` keeps `T[]`,
 * and the `any` of `getMeta()` dies at this boundary - the raw paginator would type the
 * response as the class, with `serialize`, `toJSON` and 55 more members.
