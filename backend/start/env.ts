/**
 * The single environment reader (`_standards/backend.md` §6). Every key read by
 * `env.get()` is declared here, and `pattern:check` enforces that every declared key is read
 * by someone. A dead key goes: declared without a reader, it promises a configuration that
 * does not exist.
 *
 * Required is whatever brings down the boot when missing, and bringing down the boot is the
 * desired behavior: better for the application not to start than to start with a
 * default hidden in the code. Secrets and credentials have no default.
 *
 * The blocks follow the standard's order, the same as `.env.example`.
 *
 * Extension point (KIT.md §3.4): the project switches on the optional blocks of the
 * catalog (`mail`, `queue`, `jwt`) and leaves the rest as the model has it.
